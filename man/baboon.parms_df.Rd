\description{
A dataset containing summary statistics for low density lipoprotein (LDL) and
apolipoprotein B (apo B) levels in 604 baboons measured on two different diets:
a basal diet and a high cholesterol, saturated fat diet. The baboons were
classified into one of two subspecies and a hybrid of the two subspecies
(Papio hamadryas anubis, P.h. cynocephalus, or hybrid). Each animal was
measured on each of the two diets.

The baboon data collection were supported by NIH grant HL28972 and
NIH contract HV53030 to the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research
(Now: Texas Biomedical Research Institute), and funds from the Southwest
